<h1>Basic Fundamentals</h1>
<b>The Renowned Web</b>
<p>The web is basically a group of computers that interacts with each other. When an individual
opens up a web page (<a href ="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> or 
<a href ="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>), 
their computer puts out an <b><em>HTTP</em></b> request
to an designated <b><em>server</em></b>. What the server does next is locate the required HTML 
document which it transfers back to the user's computer via an <b><em>web browser</em></b>
(Internet Explorer or Firefox) that shows up on the computer screen.
</p>


<b>H.T.M.L</b>
<p>HTML is widely used in virtually every computer concept on the web. This 
<b><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></b> is most verstaile to write any programming code. Other
languages exist such as Javascript, Python, Ruby, and so on.
</p>


<b>Tags/Elements</b>
<p>Within HTML, there are <b><em>elements</em></b> & <b><em>tags</em></b>. Elements are groups 
of code inputted while tags mark an element with a function such a name or command. Two element 
types was mentioned: <b><em>inline</em></b> and <b><em>block</em></b>. Inline breaks off <br>
and forms a new line of code. Block surrounds the content with an invisible barrier.
</p>

<b>"Dumb" Tech</b>
<p>Computers read and executes all commands with precision. If a programmer inputs specific
directions to make a computer randomize numbers or scan files, the program would run effective.
However, if one step is misplaced, the program will fail to work. Programmers label the
computers as "stupid", but we human beings create the technology so the fault is pretty 
much shared on both sides.
